In our study, we aimed to investigate the cost comparison between on-campus and off-campus living for Boston University (BU) students, focusing on expenses related to food and transportation. Conducting a Google Forms survey distributed to various student groups and peers yielded 109 responses. Despite our initial hypothesis suggesting that living off campus would be cheaper, our statistical analysis using the Large, Independent Samples Test of Hypothesis did not provide significant evidence to support this claim. Surprisingly, factors such as housing costs and financial aid were not adequately considered, potentially impacting our findings. While our data showed no significant difference in spending between on-campus and off-campus residents, there are several limitations to acknowledge, including the need for more comprehensive demographic data and longer-term data collection. Moving forward, future research should explore these factors in greater depth to provide more conclusive insights for BU and other universities.
